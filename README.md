Installation
------------
Arch Linux users can install from the [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/flatplat-theme) maintained by [@cthbleachbit](https://github.com/cthbleachbit).

### Manual Installation
1. Download and extract the [stable archive](../../releases).

  ```sh
  cd /tmp
  curl -sL https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat/archive/v20161227.tar.gz | tar xz
  ```

2. In terminal, move to the extracted directory and run `./install.sh` as root.

  ```sh
  cd Flat-Plat-20161227 && sudo ./install.sh
  ```

3. Select the theme via `gnome-tweak-tool` or other suitable tools.

4. Optionally, configure the following settings:
  - Set the system font size to `9.75` (= 13px at 96dpi) or `10.5` (= 14px at 96dpi).
  - Open the `chrome` folder on `/usr/share/themes/Flat-Plat*/` and drag and drop the `.crx` files onto the Chrome/Chromium extensions page (`chrome://extensions`).

- [:arrow_down: v3.16.20160821](../../releases/download/v3.16.20160821/Flat-Plat-3.16.20160821.tar.gz)

---

### Manual Uninstallation
- Delete the installed directories.

  ```sh
  sudo rm -rf /usr/share/themes/Flat-Plat{,-compact,-dark,-dark-compact,-light,-light-compact}
  ```

GDM (Lock/Login Screen)
-----------------------
You can change the GDM theme by replacing the default GNOME Shell theme.  
But please **be careful** because if it fails, the desktop environment may not operate correctly.
> **:warning: Cautions:**
> - When applying this, other third-party GNOME Shell themes would look broken.
> - If GNOME Shell has been updated, you will need to install this again.

### Installation
1. Back up and replace the existing `.gresource` file after selecting the GTK+ theme.

  ```sh
  GTK_THEME=$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme | sed "s/'//g")
  sudo cp -iv --backup /usr/share{/themes/$GTK_THEME,}/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource
  ```

  > _Developer note:_  
  > If you don't want to overwrite the backup on the second and subsequent runs, delete the `--backup` option.

2. Restart GNOME Shell (press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd>, then type `r`).

### Uninstallation
1. Restore to original theme from the backup.

  ```sh
  sudo mv -iv /usr/share/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource{~,}
  ```

2. Restart GNOME Shell (press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd>, then type `r`).
